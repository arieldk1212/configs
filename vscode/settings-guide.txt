theres a global settings.json, we can have a local settings.json and in there insert the following:
{
  "cmake.sourceDirectory": "/Users/arielkriheli/Projects/llvm-project/llvm",
  "cmake.configureArgs": ["-DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF"]
}
we can specify the cmake file path here and macros we want to disable/enable during compilation.
